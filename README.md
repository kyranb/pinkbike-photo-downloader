# Pinkbike Photo Downlaoder

### What is this?

Just a simple applescript that takes a pinkbike photo url and downloads the original (full resolution) source image.
This is pretty handy if you want an image printed or used as a desktop background.

### What's a pinkbike?

Pinkbike.com is the largest online community of mountain bikers. The site often features excellent photography, although most images are usually uploaded at a lower resolution to conservere bandwith.

### How do I use it?
Open the script in AppleScript Editor and click run. It will prompt you for a url, or take the current url from your clipboard.

### Any other plans?
I've got an alfred extention that implements this, let me know if you want it :)
